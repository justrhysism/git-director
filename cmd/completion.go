  $ git-director completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-director

Zsh:

# If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
# to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

# To load completions for each session, execute once:
$ git-director completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_git-director"

# You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Fish:

$ git-director completion fish | source

# To load completions for each session, execute once:
$ git-director completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/git-director.fish

Powershell:

PS> git-director completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

# To load completions for every new session, run:
PS> git-director completion powershell > git-director.ps1
# and source this file from your powershell profile.
